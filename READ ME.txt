~index.html~
 in this case im using this as a navigation page. Here it loads the calandar.component.main file from the app folder.

~calandar.component.main.ts~
 here, the bootstrap function is called. it reads the calandar component metadata, 
 finds the 'calandar' selector, locates an element tag named 'calandar' in index.html, and loads the application between those tags.

~calandar.component.ts~
 contains info on calandar component. instead of directly writing the content beside template i have it written in an external file.('calandar.html') 
 so here i just produce the url and similarly with the css. The export class CalandarComponent contains functionality for my template.

~calandar.component.html~ 
html coded template. this is the actual content of the page.(headings, tables etc)

~calandar.component.css~
 this is the design/style of the web app
